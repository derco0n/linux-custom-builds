This is a bunch of build-script for the linux-kernel with some config files optimized for ASUS EEEPC 1001PG (and may be some others)
	- Optimized for Intel Atom (instead of generic_x86)
	- Removed some uneeded stuff
		- AMD CPU-Features
		- NVIDIA and AMD Graphics support
		- RAID Stuff
		- NVME (This technology did not even exist back then)
		- misc
	- Changed default CPU governor to "CONSERVATIVE"
	

Building tested under Linux-Mint 19.


Needed:
sudo apt-get install build-essential kernel-package libncurses5-dev fakeroot wget bzip2 libelf-dev libssl-dev -y

Steps:

Optional - Setup ccache to speedup future builds:

Install ccache:
    apt install ccache -y

Make sure all compiler-symlinks are there (several symlinks e.g. gcc, g++ pointing to ccache) allowing it to work transparently without needing to change any makefile
    ls -l /usr/lib/ccache

setup your ccache config
    nano ~/.ccache/ccache.conf
        max_size=15.0G (or something else)
        cache_dir=/path/to/your/ccache-directory

put ccache to your $PATH-Variable. make sure ist before the other paths, as linux tries the first binary it can find (when firing gcc or g++ or another binary)
    nano ~/.bashrc
        Add the following line:
            export PATH="/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH"

check your configuration with:
    ccache -s
        It should like this:
            cache directory                     /path/to/your/ccache-directory
            primary config                      /root/.ccache/ccache.conf
            secondary config      (readonly)    /etc/ccache.conf

Then:


1. Download Kernel
download-kernel.sh

2. CD to kerneldir

3. Make Config
make-config.sh 

4. Compile
build-kernel.sh

5. Install Kernel
install-kernels.sh
